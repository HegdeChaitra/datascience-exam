    "First, let's think about the first time we run this. Even though we make two calls for each step of the program, the cache is being updated as we work our way down to the base cases, which are n=1,2. Because of this, since we calculate `fibonacci2(n-1)` first, the result of the `fibonacci2(n-2)` call will already be stored in the cache. Thus, the **time complexity** of this implementation would also be: \n",

    "However, since the way we're making this implementation faster is by storing computations in a cache, that necessarily means that our space complexity is going to be large. Since we store n fibonacci numbers in the cache when we run `fibonacci(n)`, the **space complexity** of this implementation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O(n)$$\n",

    "Consider the first implementation, `fibonacci(n)`. Both the best and worst case scenarios of that implementation are $O(n)$, which is okay because at least it has a consistent runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this implementation, the worst case is again $O(n)$, but the best case is $O(1)$! This is because you could just ask for a fibonacci number that has already been computed, so you can just look it up in your cache and tada you're done! Thus, the second implementation is better for situations where you want to calculate more than one fibonacci number, because you'll be able to use of the cache."

This is because if your n was larger than the highest cached fibonacci number, the algorithm would still compute all the previous fibonacci numbers, since the algorithm starts at 1.\n",
